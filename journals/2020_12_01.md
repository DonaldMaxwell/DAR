		"abstract": "Sray Agarwal is currently working for Publicis Sapient as a Data Scientist. His expertise lies in Predictive Modelling, Forecasting and advanced Machine Learning. He possesses a deep understanding of algorithms and advanced statistics. He has a background in management, economic and has done a master equivalent program in Data Science and Analytics. His current area of interest are Fair and Explainable ML.\n\nSray Agarwal was speaking at ODSC Europe 2019. \n\n→ To watch more videos like this, visit https://learnai.odsc.com/ ←\n\nToday when everything around us is affected by Machine Learning driven decisions, a few metrics derived from a black box can be highly disturbing. From getting a admission to a college (ML based selection), to getting a job (ML based job recommendation), to getting a financial service (ML based credit scoring) to even getting prosecuted (ML based recidivism prediction), every stage of life is being heavily governed by few algorithms. But the question today is how Fair and accountable are these algorithms that so widely used. The first in the series would talk about are ML models fair and if not, how can they be made fair.\n\nIn this regards, we would see how to make Model Fair and Accountable:\n1.        Fairness Metrics (statistical parity difference, equal opportunity difference, disparate impact)\n2.        Model Fairness (Prejudice remover, meta-classifier)\n3.        Prediction Fairness (equalized odds, calibrated equalized odds)\n4.        Accountability of features (sensitivity, weight of evidence, lifs/gains, accuracy drifts)\n5.        Transparency of Models (sensitivity, residuals, accumulated local effects)\n6.        Explainability of Modelling results\n7.        Stability indices (Population and Category Stability Index)\n8.        Accuracy changes (Gini, lift, RMSE, MAPE, Linear four rates, distance measures, Lorenz curve, KS stat)\n9.        Sensitivity (Individual Conditional Expectation and Partial Dependency Plots)\n10.       Decile / Score pattern to see the distribution of predictions / scores\n11.       Drift detections (Early drift detection)\n\nDo You Like This Video?
